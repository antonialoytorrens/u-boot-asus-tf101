# From U-Boot source code, see the following files o see which environment (env) variables you have available:

#
# Issues:
#
# 1. Booting from internal eMMC does not work at the moment (mmc 0:X is not detected).
# Tegra partition support driver is needed (it can be picked from grate linux kernel tree).
#
# 2. NOTICE! SD Card is detected as USB Storage Device. So, the Asus TF101 has at maximum 3 USB ports.
# U-Boot calculates how many USB Devices are there (for example, it puts 4 USB Devices when only 1 [Storage] USB Device is connected).
# But that's not a problem when booting, because it detects proper *storage* USB Devices with boot.scr included.
# NOTE: For U-Boot, USB Devices != USB Storage Devices.
# NOTE: USB can be Â´usb 0:1`, `usb 1:1` or even `usb 2:1` in TF101 when booting, but we don't know which sdX is assigned for each of them.
#
# 3. `Requested init=/init.sh failed` when booting the kernel if putting init=/init.sh as bootargs. (PostmarketOS)
#
# 4. boot.scr has to be present on MicroSD card (U-Boot reads boot.scr from MMC, and MicroSD is mmc 1:1). 
# Otherwise u-boot does not find the script. We should modify U-Boot to search boot.scr from all the devices (same order as when searching boot.scr). [SOLVED]
#
# 5. NOTICE! Cannot boot from SD Card. It finds boot.scr but we cannot boot from it, even if we have correct partition.
#  (Nasty) WORKAROUND: We can ask to users to disconnect SD Card before booting, so USB detection is way easier.
#  NOTE: usb 0:1 != sda ; usb 1:1 != sdb ; usb 2:1 != sdc ; These are totally independent.
#
# 6. We cannot type U-Boot commands with the dock keyboard. 
# That needs the asusec driver ported to U-boot (it can be picked from grate linux kernel tree).
# WORKAROUND: Connect standard USB Keyboard to the dock keyboard. The device is detected and you can successfully type anything.
#
# 7. Maybe (?) fdt resizing does not work (but this needs to be tested properly, not sure about this last issue).
